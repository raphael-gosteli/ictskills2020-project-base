# About

My JavaFX project base for Trade 9 in the ICTskills2020 championship, also known as SwissSkills Championships 2020.

# Getting Started

> âš  The following steps are incomplete and are only here to guide you in the right direction.

1. Extract the JavaFX SDK into the content/project root (you should now have a `lib/` and `bin/` folder)
2. Move Hibernate JARs into the `lib/` folder
3. Import the run configuration located at `.run/Main.run.xml`
4. Build a fat JAR
5. Run the JAR using the launcher script `launch.cmd`
